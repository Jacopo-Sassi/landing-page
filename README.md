In this project I recreated the layout of a landing page used as a template. I created the HTML file of the page from scratch, added the text, organized the space and the relationships between the different elements. I subsequently created a CSS file with which I worked on the graphic part of the page using Flexbox and further organized the space of the site. In this project I have put into play all the knowledge I have acquired up to this point of HTML and CSS and I have learned to interface with various technical problems and difficulties that I have managed to resolve through my critical thinking and the resources available online.
